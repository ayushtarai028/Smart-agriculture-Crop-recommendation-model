This model can take real time data feed from the sensors and use them to provide the farmers with the best crop that can be grown for maximum yield . Here we have used Models (Multi Layer perception  , K-nearest neighbors algorithm ,  Logistic regression , Gaussian NB) and we have used Flask to run the model in a server
